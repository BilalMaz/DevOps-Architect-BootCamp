# DevOps-Architect BootCamp 

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="Logo1.png" alt="Logo"></p>

This repository is used to document all the steps and roadmaps that contribute in the learning "<b> DevOps</b> ". I will be continue this journey till the end of 2023. The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

<br>This will not cover all things "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.<br>

<i>In this journey we will build many projects</i> <br>

# Prerequisite for DevOps   
DevOps is a methodology that focuses on collaboration and communication between software development teams and IT operations teams to streamline software delivery and improve efficiency. To become a DevOps practitioner, you need to have a solid foundation in several areas, including: <br> 
1. Software Development <br> 
2. System Administration <br>
3. Automation <br>
4. Cloud Computing <br>
5. Collaboration and Communication <br>
6. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment<br>
7. Containers and Oreshtration

# Linux Administration  

 Linux administration is the process of managing and maintaining a Linux-based operating system (OS). It involves configuring and managing various aspects of the system, such as hardware, software, and network components, to ensure that the system runs smoothly and efficiently.

Some common tasks involved in Linux administration include:

    1. Installing and configuring the operating system and software packages
    2. Managing users and groups, including setting permissions and access controls
    3. Managing file systems, including creating and managing partitions, directories, and files
    4. Managing network configurations, including configuring network interfaces, DNS, and routing
    5. Monitoring system performance, including tracking resource utilization and identifying and resolving bottlenecks
    6. Managing backups and disaster recovery processes
    7. Configuring and managing security features, including firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention, and access controls.

# Networking Fundamentals 

Networking fundamentals refer to the basic concepts, principles, and technologies that underlie computer networking. Here are some key networking fundamentals:

    1. Network architecture: This refers to the design and layout of a computer network. It includes the physical components (such as servers, switches, routers, and cables) as well as the logical components (such as protocols and services) that define how the network functions.
    2.  Protocols: These are rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted over a network. Examples of common protocols include  TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP.
    3. Network topologies: These refer to the physical layout of a network. Examples of network topologies include star, bus, and mesh.
    4. Network addressing: This involves assigning unique addresses to each device on the network, which enables them to communicate with each other. Common network addressing schemes include IP addressing and MAC addressing.
    5. Routing: This refers to the process of directing data packets between different networks. Routers are used to perform this function.
    6. Network security: This involves implementing measures to protect a network from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. Examples of network security measures include firewalls, VPNs, and encryption.
    7. Wireless networking: This involves the use of wireless technologies to connect devices to a network. Examples of wireless networking technologies include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks

# Version Control 

Version control is a system that enables you to manage changes to a file or set of files over time. It is commonly used in software development to track changes to source code, but it can also be used for other types of files such as documents, images, and configuration files.

# Continuous integration and Continuous deployment

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are two related concepts in software development that aim to streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying software.

      1. Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of frequently merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared code repository. Each code change is automatically built and tested to detect integration errors early and prevent issues from being introduced into the codebase.
      2. Continuous Deployment (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying changes to the production environment after they have been built and tested in a staging or testing environment. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are delivered to users quickly and reliably.
